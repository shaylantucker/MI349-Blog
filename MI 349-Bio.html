Hello! My name is Shaylan Tucker and I am a junior at Michigan State University. I am studying Media & Information with a minor in Graphic Design and Digital Humanities. 
I am from Linden, Michigan located right next to Fenton, Michigan. This past week I started an internship through Michigan State Library where I will be helping in the 
Digital Scholarship Lab and couldnt be more excited. Times where I am not doing class work or working at my internship, I am either out hanging on my families boat, 
hanging with friends, or out enjoying the fall weather. Fall is my favorite time of the year, so I am loving it right now! I have been going to the apple orchard and 
been traveling up north to see the fall colors.
